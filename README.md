Following the Data Cleaning process now we do some Exploratory Data Analysis to find patterns and insights in our data and gather useful information.
Following are some of the problem statements to get some key insights on the layoff dataset:
* Percentage to see how big layoffs are
* Companies with biggest single layoffs
* Companies with most layoffs
* Companies with most layoffs per year
* Total layoff per month
